## Repository Structure


## Wiki Documentation
Documentation about MAVRIC rovers, past and present, is recorded using the GitHub Wiki feature. Click the _Wiki_ tab on the MAVRIC-Systems web page to open the wiki, then use the links in the sidebar to navigate to various wiki pages. Most information is up to date and the difference should be very noticeable, but if you are not able to tell the difference between current and outdated information, ask the current Systems Team Lead about it. Remember that this repository contains documentation for at least two rovers, so information that appears outdated may simply be documenting a different rover than the one currently being developed.
