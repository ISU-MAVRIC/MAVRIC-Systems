|                     | Milestone 1  | Milestone 2 |
|:--------------------|:------------:|:-----------:|
| Name                |  Arm+Cameras | Science Rig |

## Milestone 1:  
 * Arm
   * Depends on the mechanical design completion/construction
   * Wire it up
   * Implement control endpoints
 * Cameras
   * Main Camera is visible/controllable (pan/tilt)
   * Hazard Cameras are wired
### Deliverables
 * Video of the arm being actuated by user input
 * Video of the camera feeds displaying over the wireless link
 * Description of control systems and sensors in place, including safety systems
   * Communication setup
   * Controls
     * Limits
     * Camera Visibility
 * Discussion of image quality

## Milestone 2:
The science rig will need to be designed before the implementation of the controls can be done.
During the design process, the systems team needs to make sure that we have the equipment and code to handle all sensors.
We also need to make sure the system is designed in a way that allows us to run wires.

### Deliverables
 * Video of the soil collection system being actuated
 * Description of how the system works
